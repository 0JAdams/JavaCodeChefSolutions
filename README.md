# My Java CodeChef Solutions
Solutions to some of the [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/ "CodeChef") challenges I have done. All of them are written in Java.

Due to the nature of the challenges the code is generally short and all combined into a single .java file, rather than being broken into separate files.  The goal is to find the correct answers to the challenges and to have fast enough code to process it quickly.  This sometimes results in code that isn't quite as clean as one would like, but instead results in fast code.

My experience with the challenges was that they ranged from trivial to bang-my-head-against-the-wall challenging.
